# Namma_yatri_Analysis

Namma Yatri is India's first open mobility auto-booking app. It is a community initiative to make the auto ride experience hassle-free and affordable. It is built and supported by Bangalore techies and thought leaders passionate about building a sustainable, long-term, and OPEN solution for mobility. 

This Namma Yatri application analysis offers a comprehensive overview of the app's performance, user engagement, and operational insights. It empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions, improve user experiences, and enhance the app's effectiveness in meeting the transportation needs of its users and drivers.

ï»¿Trip Completion Insights:
The dashboard likely includes data on the number of trips completed through the Namma Yatri app. This metric provides an understanding of the app's usage and its impact on the transportation needs of users.

User Activity Metrics:
It tracks how many people have logged into the application, indicating user engagement and adoption. This can help in assessing the app's popularity and growth.

Driver Earnings Analysis:
It likely includes information on how much drivers have earned through the app. This is crucial for assessing the app's economic impact on drivers and their willingness to use the platform.

Ride Request Map:
The dashboard might feature a geographical map that visualizes the areas with the highest ride requests. This can help in identifying popular pick-up and drop-off locations and can inform business decisions regarding driver allocation.

Time Series Data:
Time series data, such as trends over days, weeks, or months, can provide insights into user behavior and the app's performance over time. This could be used to identify seasonal variations or trends. In this project the dashboard includes trends of total trips, fare and distance for a particular day.

 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
To summarize performance, the dashboard includes KPIs, such as total trips completed, total user logins (Searches), total users who got trips fare, distance and duration estimates (Estimates), total users got drivers (Quotes), sum of driver earnings , and Rate of total users completed ride to total user logins (Conversion rates).

I got all these insights using My SQL and PowerBI.

# Conclusion :
                               - There is a 21% decline in users from the users who got quotes to trips cancelled by drivers. It could be due to driver being far away from the user. The best possible soulution for this could be adopting stratergic approach in deployment of drivers specifically in areas of higher cancellation rates.

                               - Also, a 19% user decline is there from searches to the users who got estimate. Possible reasons might be either due to high fare or issues with application user interface design. This could be resolved by ensuring product and UI teams to revise fares and User interface design.

                               - Ensure maximum number of drivers are strategically deployed at the duration of 1 as it is time of peak trips, fare and distance for a day.
